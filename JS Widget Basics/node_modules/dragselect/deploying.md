## Deploying

Tipically you don’t have to do this, since you most likely are not the project owner.  
But if you are the project owner:

1. do thorough testing
2. bump version in .js file
3. run `gulp`
4. pushed everything

5. you can deploy a new version using:

```
npm run deploy
```

This will build the package and push the changes to `github pages`. Thus also updating the online html and the examples.  
If this was successful, the next step is to publish the new version on `npm`:

```
npm version patch
npm publish
```

versions are either `patch` wich changes 0.0.x, `minor` wich changes 0.x.0 or `major` for x.0.0.  
See [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages)  

After that run `npm run deploy` again, just to make sure
